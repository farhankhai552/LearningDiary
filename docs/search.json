Different objects have different signatures) through space and time\nBiophysical parameters (i.e. temperature, leaf area index, NDVI) are needed\nScattering leads to adjacency = radiance from nearby pixels is mixed into pixel of interest\nCorrection methods:\n\nRelative (when compared to others)\n\nSpectral band = A wavelength range in the spectrum of reflected or radiated electromagnetic (EM) energy to which a remote sensor is sensitive\nTo normalise intensities of different bands relative to each other within a single image\nTo normalise intensities of bands from many dates to one date\nRelative correction methods\n\nDark object saturation = Effects of atmos scattering are removed by finding the darkest pixels in an image and subtracting their values from all other pixels\nPseudo-invariant features = technique is based on the statistical invariance of the reflectance of man-made in-scene elements such as concrete, asphalt, and rooftops. Differences in the grey-level distributions of these invariant objects is assumed to be a linear function and is corrected statistically to perform the normalisation. The technique exhibits errors in reflectance of approximately 1% for Landsat TM and high-resolution air photo imagery in all spectral regions studied\n\n\nAbsolute = definitive\n\nChanging of digital brightness into scaled surface reflectance (amount of light reflected by the surface of the Earth)\nAbsolute correction is done via atmospheric radiative transfer models (many to select from)\nAbsolute data requirements\n\nModel - can be selected from the tool\nLocal atmospheric visibility - from places such as a weather station, etc\nImage altitude\n\nAbsolute tools (there are free and more expensive tools\n\nEmpirical line correction\n\nAlternative to radiative transfer modeling\nUses field spectrometer\n\nmeasures albedo (expression of the ability of surfaces to reflect heat from the sun)\n& spectral reflectance (fraction of incoming solar radiation that is reflected from Earth’s surface)\nHow it works = takes in light, break it into its spectral components, digitise the signal as a function of wavelength, and read it out and display it through a computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthorectification/topographic\n\nDistortions are removed to allow for pixels to be viewed from straight above (at nadir)\n\nRequires sensor geometry and an elevation model (DEM = topographic representation of bare Earth surface excluding physical characteristics)\n\nFeatures within orthorectified image will be straightened (as influence of topography has been removed.\n\n\n\nFormulae that can be used for correction\n\nCosine correction = refers to the human perception of light incident on a surface.

The output raster from image classification can be used to create thematic maps.\n\n\nImage enhancement\n\nWhat is it = the process of making an image more interpretable for a particular application (Faust, 1989). Enhancement makes important features of raw, remotely sensed data more interpretable to the human eye.\nMethod\n\nContrast enhancement\nSpatial filtering\nDensity slicing\n\n\nKey concepts\n\nSpectral (from EM spectrum) = the intensity of light as it varies with wavelength or frequency.\nIrradiance = Energy at all angles and directions.\nRadiance = energy reflected from source to sensor.\nReflectance = ratio of the amount of light leaving a target to the amount of light striking the target. It has no units. In other words, property of material/surface being observed.\nSurface reflectance = amount of light reflected by the surface of the Earth. It is a ratio of surface radiance to surface irradiance, and as such is unitless, with values between 0 and 1. In short, efficiency of surface in reflecting radiant energy.\nSpectral band = a region/range/layers in the EM spectrum in a range of wavelengths.\nSpectral signature = unique wavelength radiated by an object.\n\nApplications\n\nRaw remotely sensed image data are full of geometric and radiometric flaws caused by the curved shape of the Earth, the imperfectly transparent atmosphere, daily and seasonal variations in the amount of solar radiation received at the surface, and imperfections in scanning instruments, among other things.\nImage correction and enhancement methods allow for clearer image interpretation, resulting in more accurate interpretations of topography and physical features, which in turn allows for accurate analysis and on-the ground responses pertaining to land monitoring, disaster response, environmental study, and resource exploration.\n\nReflection\n\nAlthough most remotely sensed data nowadays has already been corrected and enhanced for ease of use, it is important to understand the methods and relevant situations.\nNo method is perfect, depends on situation and information available in order to conduct correction.\nAdditionally, not all remotely sensed data has been image corrected (depending on sensor source).\nUltimate goal is to eliminate any distortions to the best of our abilities to produce an image that best reflects the at-ground status of the location pictured by removing any possible factors of interference."

    "text": "Malaysia’s disaster risk profile\n\nWorst floods in the past 30 years have occurred from 2003 onwards. The majority of natural disasters from 1998 to 2018 were natural disasters (38/51).\nMalaysia had the highest percentage (67%) of the population exposed to floods among ASEAN Member States (between July 2012 and January 2019) as reported by ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management in March 2019.\nNine percent of land area in Malaysia is flood prone and 4.8 million people live in areas at risk to flood.\nMonsoon and flash floods are the primary climate related natural disasters in the country.\nMalaysia’s flood prone area covers approximately 29 km and affects more than 4.82 million people. \nAdditionally, annual damage caused by floods has cost an annual US $4.82 million.\nMost areas of the Asian region lack sufficient observational records to draw conclusions about trends in annual precipitation over the past century (seeWGIAR5 Chapter 2; Figure 24-2;Table SM24-2).\n\n\n\nCornerstone of Malaysian framework creation\n\nLocal directives and plans\n\nBased on Directive 20 of National Disaster Management Relief (acts as a framework for policy building), Directive 20 is carried out by the National Disaster Management and Relief Committee (NDRMC)\nEleventh Malaysia Plan: Chapter 6, Focus Area D: Strengthening Resilience Against Climate Change and Natural Disasters. As Malaysia develops socioeconomically, the country is focused on resilient growth to ensure its development gains are not reversed by natural disasters. Therefore, planning and preparing for natural disasters, identifying which areas and communities are at risk, and providing the right tools in case such situations occur are important strategies highlighted in the Plan with regard to preparing a comprehensive disaster risk management (DM) framework and protecting the resiliency of the country and its future.\n\nInternationally ratified agreements and frameworks\n\nCOP26\nC40 Cities\nSustainable Developments Goals\nSendai framework\n\nLaws and policies\n\nPreventative measures instituted to minimise impact \n\nThe Land Conservation Act 1960 \nEnvironmental Quality Act 1974 \nLocal Government Act 1976 \nRoad, Drainage and Building Act 1974\nOccupational Safety and Health Act 1994\nUniform Building Bylaws 1984 \n\nDisaster Risk Management Laws include\n\n1951 Civil Defence Act (Revised 1979) \n1964 Emergency (Essential Powers) Act \n1979 Emergency (Essential Powers) Act \n1997 Policy and Mechanism of National \nDisaster Management and Relief NSC Directive \n1998 Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act \n1998 Fire Services Act 341 \n2016 Civil Defence (Amendment)\n2016 National Security Council Act\nAdditional Acts\n\nNational Security Act 2016\n\n\n\n\nMalaysian Disaster Risk Reduction and Mitigation Framework\n\nNational Disaster Management and Relief Committee (NDRMC):\n\nIn charge of crafting national policies pertaining to disaster response using the No.20 directive as a guideline.\n\nNational Disaster Management Agency (NADMA)\n\nNADMA is focal point of disaster risk reduction\nNADMA consolidates roles of different agencies, such as\n\nDisaster management division of NSC\nPost flood recovery unity of PM dept\nSpecial Malaysia Disaster Assistance and Rescue Agency (SMART)\nUnder NADMA, strategic partners include\n\n NADMA is also responsible for Early Communications System, which consists of:\n\nMMD (Malaysian Meteorological Department)\nDepartment of Irrigation and Drainage\nMalaysian Remote Sensing Agency\n\n\n\nHow can remotely sensed data be applied to solve policy challenges?\n\nCurrent policy challenge\n\npolicies which exist are not comprehensive enough to plan ahead of disaster risk, and are too reactive in nature. Additionally, not all relevant departments are tied to disaster-related policies (Ministry of Works, Ministry of Housing, Ministry of Agriculture, etc).\n\nPolicy goals\n\n A more comprehensive response to account for all stages of disaster preparedness and mitigation. This will help in preempting locations within Malaysia which may suffer from a risk of disasters in the future, allowing for the implementation of planning laws that can help address this issue before population displacement happens. \nMore holistic policies will also help to align the country’s goals  with internationally ratified agreements, many of which Malaysia is a part of. These include COP26, C40 cities, Sendai Framework, Sustainable Development Goals under the UNDP, and more. \nTo expand accessibility of findings beyond disaster response to incorporate involvement of all relevant departments and ministries.\n\nHow to address this using remotely sensed data\n\nSAR-based flood monitoring for accurate real-time monitoring\n\nRapid assessment: Quick acquisition and processing of data, enabling faster response to flood events\nWide-area coverage: Large-scale flood monitoring, even in remote or inaccessible areas\nAll-weather capability: Reliable data collection, regardless of weather conditions or time of day\n\nModel for future flood-prone area prediction\n\n\nReflection on lessons learned (in relation to policy, city and the application of the data)\n\nPolicy implementation requires proper coordination between relevant stakeholders to carry out policy goals in an efficient manner, with each key player understanding which part they play. Fragmentation and unclear division of labour in terms of role responsibility may cause confusion due to overlapping roles.\nThe democratisation of data accessibility and the development of satellite data has allowed for more creative methods of solving issues pertaining to natural disasters. This is especially important for developing countries, particularly in the global South with lack of access to technology and manpower to help assess issues and form relevant solutions.\nDespite the existence of internationally ratified agreements working towards forming sustainable city policies, many developing nations are at a significant disadvantage due to a lack of prior access and technology. While richer nations (typically located in the West) may already have infrastructure in place, poorer nations are still working towards building infrastructure. As a result, their preparedness and response times to disasters are delayed."

    "text": "The process of separating and organising data into relevant groups (“classes”) based on their shared characteristics. Within remotely sensed data, these traits can be in the form of topography, temperature, etc\n\nWhat is land use and land cover and why is its classification useful?\n\nLand cover indicates the visible surface of land (e.g. crops, grass, water, broad-leaved forest or built-up area). Land use indicates the socioeconomic purpose for which the land is used (e.g. agriculture, forestry, recreation or residential use)\nClassification of LULC is the process of assigning each pixel or area of the land surface into different categories or classes based on the features extracted from satellite images or other geospatial data sources\nLand use classification provides a basis for the sustainable development of land resources in both urban and rural contexts and to inform the development of policies across all areas of human activity at national, regional and local levels, including planning and regeneration, housing, employment, transport, agriculture, environment and recreation.\n\n\n\nLand Use Land Cover Modeling | U.S. Geological Survey\n\n\nCountries like the United Kingdom have created a consistent classification system to allow for standardisation of collection and interpretation of LULC data. This will allow for different sectors to link their findings and collaborate based on data analysis.\n\nExpert systems and machine learning\n\nExpert system: an Artificial Intelligence software which extracts information from databases of expert knowledge in order to simulate judgement similar to that of a human’s\nMachine learning: A system makes solutions based on knowledge made available to the system (inductive learning). When new information is fed to the machine, judgments are refined, using a ‘supervised learning algorithm’.\n\nMachine learning method types/ types of decision tree algorithms\n\nCART\n\na decision tree algorithm useful for both classification and regression tasks. \nFor classification tasks, the goal of the CART algorithm is to maximise the purity of the subsets at each node, where purity is measured by a metric such as the Gini index or entropy. For regression tasks, the goal is to minimise the mean squared error (MSE) of the subsets at each node.\nit is prone to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. To overcome this, techniques such as pruning, regularisation, and ensemble methods can be used to improve the performance and generalisation of the model.\nUseful for handling both categorical and continuous target variables.\n\nRegression trees\n\nDecision tree algorithm that is used for predicting continuous numerical values. Regression trees work by recursively partitioning the feature space into non-overlapping regions or segments, where each segment corresponds to a specific prediction value for the target variable.\nAt each node of the tree, the algorithm selects the feature and threshold that provides the best split of the data, based on a metric such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE). The data are then split into two subsets based on the selected feature and threshold. Process is repeated until criterion is met\nThese are useful in a variety of applications where the target variable is continuous and has a nonlinear relationship with the features.\nSpecialised for predicting continuous values\n\nRandom forest\n\nA method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.\nIt can carry out both regression and classification tasks. \n\nSupervised and unsupervised learning\n\nSupervised learning: algorithm is trained on labeled data. Objective of the algorithm is to learn a mapping between the input features and the output targets, so that it can predict the output labels for new, unseen input data. Unsupervised learning is used for tasks such as classification, regression, and object detection.\nUnsupervised learning: algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, where only the input features are provided, without any corresponding output labels or targets. The objective of the algorithm is to find patterns, relationships, and structure in the data. Unsupervised learning is used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection\nKey differences between learning types:\n\nInput data\nObjective\nTypes of problems addressed\n\n\nMaximum likelihood\n\nstatistical method for estimating population parameters (such as the mean and variance) from sample data, by finding the parameter values that maximise the likelihood of making the observations given the parameter.\nIn simpler terms, it is the method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data.\nProvides a consistent approach to parameter estimation problems.\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nA machine learning algorithm that uses supervised learning models to solve complex classification, regression, and outlier detection problems by performing optimal data transformations that determine boundaries between data points based on predefined classes, labels, or outputs.\nPurpose of SVM is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N — the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.\nIn simpler terms, it conducts data transformation, and then separates data based on labels and outputs defined. \n\n\n\nApplications\n\nMachine learning solutions mainly focus on solving regression and classification-related issues.\nWithin the context of spatial analysis, this is useful to classify different LULC types, in order to better identify physical features for more accurate responses such as for natural disaster response, urban planning, green space planning, urban development, weather forecasting, and so on.\nHow is classified data used in a practical setting?\n\nObservation of urban expansion using Landsat data\nObservation of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and its effects on air pollution, using Sentinel-3 (Sea and Land Surface Temperature) and Sentinel-5 (Precursor Major Air Pollutants)\nDetection of urban green spaces\nMonitoring of forest density/illegal logging practices\nMapping of forest fire spread for hazard determination\n\n\n\nReflections\n\nAvailability of modern data-driven methods allows for better LULC utilisation, particularly through data classification.\nA variety of data classification methods exist to address specific issues with categorising remotely sensed data\nMore accurate classification means better responses which reflect actual LULC conditions.\nAccurate classification also opens up the opportunity of incorporating machine learning into mainstream urban development issues, due to findings accuracy being useful for interpretation."

    "text": "5.2 Part 2: How to use GEE\nComponents of GEE\n\nObjects \n\nincludes vector, raster, feature, string, number\nEach object belongs to a class\nEach class has a specific function within GEE (also known as methods)\n\nGeometry = point/line/polygon with no attributes\nFeature = geometry with attributes\nFeature collection = several features with attributes\n\nGEE functions and tools\n\nLoading image collections\nReducing images (by region, regions, or neighbourhoods)\n\nTo summarise collection of images into one image composite\nReduction methods include: median, region, neighbourhood, linear regression\n\nWith median = median value of each pixel is used to make image composite\nBy region = useful for conducting statistical analysis on a single area\nBy neighbourhood = kernel neighbourhood is used to reduce image (as opposed to region boundary). Mean/min/max value of neighbour pixels surrounding central pixel are calculated\nLinear regression = to determine change in pixel values over time\n\n\nJoins and filtering\n\n\nApplications\n\nEnvironmental monitoring: GEE has several tools for analysing and monitoring the environment, such as mapping deforestation, identifying areas at risk of drought or flooding, tracking wildlife, and monitoring the effects of climate change.\nLULC: can be used to map and monitor crop growth, track land use changes, and help with precision farming. By using satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms, it can provide detailed information about soil moisture, vegetation health, and other key variables.\nDisaster Response and Mitigation: During natural disasters, GEEcan be used to quickly generate maps and identify areas at risk. It can also be used to monitor ongoing disasters, track the spread of wildfires, and assess damage after the event. This can help first responders and relief organisations allocate resources more effectively.\nUrban Planning: GEE can help urban planners and policymakers make informed decisions about where to build infrastructure and how to manage resources. For example, it can be used to analyse traffic patterns, identify areas at risk of flooding, and monitor urbanisation trends.\n\n\nReflection\n\nGEE contains a wealth of geospatial data to be used for free. This helps democratise the process of remote sensing. The terminal is also user-friendly and allows for beginners to extract remotely sensed data with ease.\nScalability capabilities of GEE are incredibly useful when dealing with large datasets\nCost effectiveness of GEE and its user-friendliness helps with introducing remote sensing methods to the masses.\nUltimately, the process behind interpreting remotely sensed data is the same in terms of technique, and usually only differs in name. This streamlines the process of understanding how to code better. If you understand one way to do it, it won’t be difficult for you to understand how other methods are carried out as the core aspects remain similar."

    "text": "The retention of heat by urban cores due to physical and material properties/features such as lack of trees and vegetation, dark roads and asphalt, waste heat from factories, and vehicles, and buildings.\n\n\n\nHow Landscape Architecture Mitigates the Urban Heat Island Effect - Land8\n\n\n\nUrban heat island effects\n\nClimate: increased rainfall, precipitation rates.\nSocietal health: heat cramps, heat waves, and heat strokes. Increase in pollutants such as volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide are also harmful to human health.\nEnergy usage: increase in energy costs in urban areas that face high temperatures via air-conditioning and refrigeration usage.\n\nGlobal Policies\n\nNew Urban Agenda\n\nPrinciples and standards for planning, construction, development, and management.\nFocuses on renewable and affordable energy, as well as sustainable transport infrastructure.\nHighlights the necessity to focus on transport and energy for all, particularly the underprivileged.\nPromotion of safe, accessible, and green public spaces (such as streets, sidewalks, squares, parks, etc).\n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nFocus on need to create resilient and sustainable cities for humans.\nThe support of urban planning that is integrated into development plans.\nCOP26: Beat the Heat Handbook.\n\n\nLocal Policies\n\nBarcelona: Superblocks model\n\nUrban and transport planning strategy aimed at reducing motorised transport usage within cities and reclaim public spaces for humans.\n\nColombia: Medellin green Corridors\n\ngreen areas with thick vegetation are introduced along parts of the city.\n\nAustralia: Turn Down the Heat Strategy and Action Plan (2018)\nCity policies focusing on temperature reduction\nSingapore planning requirements\nFremantle's Urban Forest Plan\n\n\nApplication\n\nClimate-specific policy is needed in an era of unprecedented globalisation and industrialisation, which birth city-specific problems.\nWithin the context of this week's topic, policy to address UHI issues have manifested themselves in creative ways, from structured planning guidelines in Singapore to unique urban development plans such as in Colombia and Barcelona.\nApplications for temperature (and other climate-related) policies include: sustainable living via green spaces for humans, planning requirements that are not environmentally detrimental and that prioritise human accessibility, health preservation of humans, particularly those most prone to heat effects, development of sustainable transport options.\n\nReflection\n\nInternational guidelines act as a blueprint for cities to hone in on specific development plans in line with sustainable living.\nIt is important to note that solutions cannot be copypasted for each city. This is because each city faces highly specific, cultural and location-based challenges. Therefore, frameworks for sustainable living within cities must be tailor-made.\nPolicies addressing current climate issues must be formed and reiterated upon to reflect modern sensibilities and solutions. As such, a dynamic and flexible framework is needed by any and all metropolitan areas.\nMany countries are lacking in in-depth policy solutions which incorporate data-driven methods for more effective policy implementation."
