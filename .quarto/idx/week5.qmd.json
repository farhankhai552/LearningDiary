Mean/min/max value of neighbour pixels surrounding central pixel are calculated\n\n        -   Linear regression = to determine change in pixel values over time\n\n-   Joins and filtering\\\n\n**Applications**\n\n-   Environmental monitoring: GEE has several tools for analysing and monitoring the environment, such as mapping deforestation, identifying areas at risk of drought or flooding, tracking wildlife, and monitoring the effects of climate change.\n\n-   LULC: can be used to map and monitor crop growth, track land use changes, and help with precision farming. By using satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms, it can provide detailed information about soil moisture, vegetation health, and other key variables.\n\n-   Disaster Response and Mitigation: During natural disasters, GEEcan be used to quickly generate maps and identify areas at risk. It can also be used to monitor ongoing disasters, track the spread of wildfires, and assess damage after the event. This can help first responders and relief organisations allocate resources more effectively.\n\n-   Urban Planning: GEE can help urban planners and policymakers make informed decisions about where to build infrastructure and how to manage resources. For example, it can be used to analyse traffic patterns, identify areas at risk of flooding, and monitor urbanisation trends.\\\n\n**Reflection**\n\n-   GEE contains a wealth of geospatial data to be used for free. This helps democratise the process of remote sensing. The terminal is also user-friendly and allows for beginners to extract remotely sensed data with ease.\n\n-   Scalability capabilities of GEE are incredibly useful when dealing with large datasets\n\n-   Cost effectiveness of GEE and its user-friendliness helps with introducing remote sensing methods to the masses.\n\n-   Ultimately, the process behind interpreting remotely sensed data is the same in terms of technique, and usually only differs in name. This streamlines the process of understanding how to code better. If you understand one way to do it, it won't be difficult for you to understand how other methods are carried out as the core aspects remain similar.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"week5.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"week5.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
